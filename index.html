    <p>Growing up, my father taught me many valuable lessons, specifically: to be kind to everyone and to never give up. ... My dad is the kindest man that I have ever met. He never talks bad about others, always helps other people, and always tries to do the right thing no matter what the cost to himself.<br><br>Through his daily actions and by example, Dad taught me many valuable lessons. His influence was far reaching, both professionally and personally. He taught me the value of a good education, as well as the importance of having a strong work ethic and unwavering love of family.</p></center>
